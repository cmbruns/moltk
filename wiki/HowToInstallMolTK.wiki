#summary How to install MolTK

= Introduction =

This document explains how to install MolTK.

= How to Install the MolTK Application =
The MolTK application won't be released until MolTK version 0.7.

= How to Install the Interactive MolTK Python Module =

== Installing the MolTK python module for Windows ==
  * Install [http://www.python.org/download/ 32-bit Python 2.7]
  * Put python on your path
    Start -> Control Panel -> (System and Security) -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables (in Advanced tab) -> Edit "Path" in System variables -> Add ";C:\Python27" (without the quotation marks) onto the end of the current text in the Variable value field -> Click OK
  * Install the [http://code.google.com/p/moltk/downloads/list MolTK Python module for windows]

== Installing the MolTK python module for Mac ==
  * Install [http://www.python.org/download/ Python 2.6]
  * The MolTK python module for Mac won't be released until MolTK version 0.6.

== Installing the MolTK python module for Linux ==
  * The MolTK python module for Linux won't be released until MolTK version 0.6.

= How to Install the MolTK C++ SDK =
The MolTK C++ SDK won't be released until MolTK version 0.5.

= How to Build MolTK from Source Code =
  * Only build from source if you cannot find a binary installer for your system.
== Additional prerequisites for building MolTK from source code ==
  * C++ compiler
    # Windows
      Use Visual Studio 9 (2008), if you intend to use the standard python 2.7 install.<br/>
      http://www.microsoft.com/express/downloads/
    # Mac
      Use gcc.<br/>
      You might need to install XCode developer tools to get gcc.
    # Linux
      Use gcc.
  * Boost, including iostreams and python libraries
    # Windows
      Get it from http://www.boostpro.com/download/ to get prebuilt binary libraries.
      Be sure to select the iostream and python libraries, and to select Visual Studio 9.  It might take several tries for the install to complete successfully.
    # Mac
      I like to build fat binaries supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.  So I build boost like:<br/>
      ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local<br/>
      sudo ./b2 address-model=32_64 architecture=x86 variant=release link=shared,static install<br/>
      <or to include PowerPC, which Python still does><br/>
      sudo ./b2 address-model=32_64 architecture=combined variant=release link=shared,static install
  * CMake
     http://www.cmake.org

= Extend MolTK/Regenerate Python Bindings =
  * Only regenerate python bindings if you have changed the MolTK API.
== Additional prerequisites for regenerating python bindings ==
  * gccxml
    (you might need to install cvs first)<br/>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML login
      (respond with password gccxml) 
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML co gccxml<br/>
    (install using cmake)<br/>
    (add location of gccxml.exe to your PATH)<br/>
    (on windows: run gccxml_vcconfig.bat from install area)<br/>
    On Windows, install to a directory without any space characters, i.e. NOT c:/Program Files/whatever
  * pygccxml
    svn checkout https://pygccxml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pygccxml/pygccxml_dev pygccxml<br/>
    cd pygccxml<br/>
    python setup.py build<br/>
    python setup.py install<br/>
    On windows, patch pygccxml/parser/source_reader.py method __create_command_line to NOT wrap command with double quotes.
