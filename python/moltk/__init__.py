"""
The moltk module provides tools for protein sequence/structure alignment and visualization.

The submodule "moltk._moltk" represents the binary extension implemented in C++.  The top
level module "moltk" contains all of the symbols from "moltk._moltk", so use "import moltk"
of "from moltk import <whatever>" to get symbols from "moltk._moltk".

The submodule "moltk.gui" contains the pure python moltk application and user interface.  
The PySide package (http://www.pyside.org/) must be installed to use the moltk.gui package.
