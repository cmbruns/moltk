Prerequisites for building moltk:

1) Boost, including iostreams library.  
    On windows get it from http://www.boostpro.com/download/.
    On Mac, I like to build fat binaries supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.  So I build boost like:
        ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local
        sudo ./bjam address-model=32_64 architecture=x86 variant=release link=shared,static install

2) CMake

3) C++ compiler.  On windows, use Visual Studio 2008, if you intend to use python.

4) Python
